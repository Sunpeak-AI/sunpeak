## Overview

sunpeak is an npm package that helps you build MCP Apps — interactive UIs that run inside AI chat hosts like ChatGPT and Claude. sunpeak consists of:

### The sunpeak Library

1. **[Runtime APIs](/library/runtime-apis)**: Strongly typed APIs for the MCP Apps runtime, **architected for multi-platform support** (ChatGPT, Claude, and more).
2. **[Simulator](/library/chatgpt-simulator)**: React component replicating the host runtime to **test Apps locally and automatically**.
3. **[MCP Server](/library/mcp-server)**: Serve Resources with mock data to real hosts with HMR (**no more cache issues or 5-click manual refreshes**).

### The sunpeak Framework

Next.js for MCP Apps. Using a Review page as an example, sunpeak projects look like:

<ProjectStructure />

1. **[Project Scaffold](/template/project-scaffold)**: Complete development setup with the sunpeak library.
2. **[UI Components](/template/ui-components)**: Production-ready components following MCP App design guidelines.
3. **Convention over configuration**:
   - Create UIs by creating a `-resource.tsx` file that exports a `ResourceConfig` and a React component ([example](#resource)).
   - Create test state (simulations) for local dev, host testing, automated testing, and demos by creating a `-simulation.json` file ([example](#simulation)).

### The sunpeak CLI

Commands for managing MCP Apps:

- `sunpeak new` - Create a new project
- `sunpeak dev` - Start dev server with MCP endpoint and live simulator
- `sunpeak build` - Build resources for production
- `sunpeak upgrade` - Upgrade sunpeak to latest version
