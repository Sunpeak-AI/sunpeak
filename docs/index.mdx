**Definitions**: The UI of an MCP App is an MCP Resource.
We will use these terms interchangeably. More on MCP [here](library/mcp-server).

## Overview

sunpeak is an npm package that helps you build MCP Apps — interactive UIs that run inside AI chat hosts like ChatGPT and Claude. sunpeak consists of:

### The sunpeak Library

1. **[Runtime APIs](/library/runtime-apis)**: Strongly typed APIs for the MCP Apps runtime, **architected for multi-platform support** (ChatGPT, Claude, and more).
2. **[Simulator](/library/chatgpt-simulator)**: React component replicating the host runtime to **test Apps locally and automatically**.
3. **[MCP Server](/library/mcp-server)**: Serve Resources with mock data to real hosts with HMR (**no more cache issues or 5-click manual refreshes**).

### The sunpeak Framework

Next.js for MCP Apps. Using a Review page as an example, sunpeak projects look like:

<ProjectStructure />

1. **[Project Scaffold](/template/project-scaffold)**: Complete development setup with the sunpeak library.
2. **[UI Components](/template/ui-components)**: Production-ready components following MCP App design guidelines.
3. **Convention over configuration**:
   - Create UIs by creating a `-resource.tsx` file that exports a `ResourceConfig` and a React component ([example](#resource)).
   - Create test state (simulations) for local dev, host testing, automated testing, and demos by creating a `-simulation.json` file ([example](#simulation)).

### The sunpeak CLI

Commands for managing MCP Apps. Includes a client for the [sunpeak Resource Repository](https://app.sunpeak.ai/). The repository helps you & your CI/CD decouple your App from your client-agnostic MCP server while also providing a hosted runtime to collaborate, demo, and share your MCP Apps.

Think Docker Hub for MCP Apps:

1. Tag your app builds with version numbers and environment names (like `v1.0.0` and `prod`)
2. `push` built Apps to a central location
3. `pull` built Apps to be run in different environments, like your production MCP server.
4. Share your fully-functional demo Apps with teammates, prospects, and strangers!
