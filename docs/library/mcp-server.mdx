## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server lets you serve your simulations to AI hosts like ChatGPT. Once running, the host can discover and render your MCP Apps.

sunpeak includes an MCP server implementation that serves your apps out-of-the-box.

## What is MCP?

MCP is the protocol AI hosts use to communicate with your servers. It handles:

- Resource & Tool registration and discovery
- Tool invocation and state synchronization

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Framework">
    Start the development server:

    ```bash
    sunpeak dev
    ```

    This starts both the simulator and an MCP server with Hot Module Reload.
    The MCP server runs on port `8000` and serves your resources with automatic rebuilding.

  <Tab title="Library">
    Configure the MCP server manually. See [runMCPServer API Reference](/api-reference/simulations/run-mcp-server) for setup instructions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then connect to a host using a tunnel. See [runMCPServer API Reference](/api-reference/simulations/run-mcp-server#connecting-to-chatgpt) for the full connection flow.
