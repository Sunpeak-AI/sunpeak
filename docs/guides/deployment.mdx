## Build for Production

Build your app for production using the Sunpeak CLI:

```bash
sunpeak build
```

This generates optimized JavaScript bundles in your `dist/` directory. Each resource gets its own bundle file that can be served by your MCP server.

## Publish to ChatGPT

Publish your MCP App to ChatGPT via the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/apps-manage).

### Prerequisites

- A ChatGPT App created on the OpenAI Platform
- Your MCP server configured and accessible to ChatGPT
- Built resources (run `sunpeak build`)

### Serving Resources

Your production MCP server needs to serve the built resource bundles. The resources should be accessible via HTTP(S) URLs that ChatGPT can fetch.

Example server setup:

```typescript
import { readFileSync, readdirSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Load all built resources
const distDir = './dist';
const files = readdirSync(distDir).filter(f => f.endsWith('.js'));

const resources = files.map(file => {
  const name = file.replace('.js', '');
  const bundle = readFileSync(join(distDir, file), 'utf-8');
  return { name, bundle };
});
```

### Environment Variables

Configure your production environment:

- Set appropriate CSP (Content Security Policy) for your resources
- Configure CORS if serving from a different domain
- Set up HTTPS for secure communication
