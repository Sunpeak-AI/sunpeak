## Overview

The `sunpeak upgrade` command checks for new versions of sunpeak and optionally upgrades to the latest version.

```bash
sunpeak upgrade
```

## How It Works

The upgrade command:

1. Checks your currently installed version
2. Fetches the latest version from npm
3. Compares versions and reports if an update is available
4. Automatically upgrades using your package manager (unless `--check` is specified)

```bash
$ sunpeak upgrade
Current version: 0.11.0
Latest version: 0.12.1

Upgrading sunpeak...
✓ Successfully upgraded to 0.12.1
```

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--check` | `-c` | Check for updates without installing |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message |

## Usage Examples

### Upgrade to Latest

```bash
sunpeak upgrade
```

### Check for Updates Only

See if a new version is available without installing:

```bash
sunpeak upgrade --check
```

```bash
$ sunpeak upgrade --check
Current version: 0.11.0
Latest version: 0.12.1

A new version is available! Run "sunpeak upgrade" to update.
```

## Package Manager Detection

The command automatically detects and uses your package manager:

- **pnpm** - `pnpm add -g sunpeak`
- **npm** - `npm install -g sunpeak`
- **yarn** - `yarn global add sunpeak`

If automatic upgrade fails, manual upgrade instructions are displayed.

## Already Up to Date

If you're already on the latest version:

```bash
$ sunpeak upgrade
Current version: 0.12.1
Latest version: 0.12.1

✓ You're already on the latest version!
```
