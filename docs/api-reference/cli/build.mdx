## Overview

The `sunpeak build` command creates optimized, production-ready bundles for your MCP Resources. Each Resource file is built as a separate, standalone HTML bundle.

```bash
sunpeak build
```


## Output

The build process creates:

- **Minified HTML** - Optimized and compressed for minimal file size
- **CSS extraction** - Unused Tailwind styles removed automatically
- **Asset optimization** - Static assets with hashed filenames for caching
- **Source maps** - For debugging production issues

### Output Directory

```
dist/
├── search/
│   ├── search.html                      # Built resource bundle
│   └── search.json                      # Resource metadata (extracted from .tsx)
├── calendar/
│   ├── calendar.html
│   └── calendar.json
```

Each resource folder from `src/resources/{name}/` is built to `dist/{name}/`, containing the HTML bundle and metadata. The `.json` file is extracted from the `resource` export in your `.tsx` file. Simulation files are not included in the build output.

## Automatic Discovery

The build automatically discovers and builds all resource folders:

```
src/resources/{name}/{name}-resource.tsx
```

For example:
- `src/resources/search/` → `dist/search/search.html` + `dist/search/search.json`
- `src/resources/calendar/` → `dist/calendar/calendar.html` + `dist/calendar/calendar.json`

### Metadata JSON Files

The build extracts the `resource` export from each `*-resource.tsx` file and writes it to a JSON file with a generated `uri` field:

```json
{
  "name": "search",
  "title": "Search App",
  "description": "A search interface",
  "mimeType": "text/html;profile=mcp-app",
  "uri": "ui://search-mjdoy6rs",
  "_meta": { ... }
}
```

The `uri` is generated using the resource name and a build timestamp for cache invalidation.

<Note>
No entry point configuration needed! The framework handles discovery automatically.
</Note>

## Build Optimizations

### Tree Shaking

Unused code is automatically removed from the bundle:

```tsx
// Only the imported components are included in the bundle
import { Card, Button } from 'sunpeak';
```

### Code Splitting

Each Resource is built as a separate bundle:

- Reduces initial load time
- Allows independent updates
- Improves caching

### CSS Purging

Tailwind CSS automatically removes unused utility classes:

- Only classes actually used in your components are included
- Significantly reduces CSS file size
- No manual configuration required

## Usage

```bash
sunpeak build
```

## Deployment

After building, deploy the `dist/` directory to any static hosting service:
