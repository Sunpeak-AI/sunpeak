description: "Access the App instance from context."

## Overview

The `useApp` hook returns the `App` instance from the nearest `AppProvider`. Use this when you need direct access to the `App` for SDK method calls like `app.requestDisplayMode()`. Most hooks read from context internally, so you typically only need `useApp()` for direct SDK calls.

The `AppProvider` handles connecting to the MCP Apps host, HMR persistence during development, and React StrictMode compatibility. It is set up automatically by the sunpeak framework — you never need to write it yourself.

## Import

```tsx
import { useApp } from 'sunpeak';
```

## Signature

```tsx
function useApp(): App | null
```

## Returns

<ResponseField name="return" type="App | null">
  The connected App instance, or `null` while connecting.
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```tsx
import { useApp } from 'sunpeak';

function MyResource() {
  const app = useApp();

  const handleFullscreen = () => {
    app?.requestDisplayMode({ mode: 'fullscreen' });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleFullscreen}>Go Fullscreen</button>;
}
```

## AppProvider

The `AppProvider` component wraps your resource component tree and establishes the connection to the MCP Apps host. It is added automatically by the sunpeak framework in both dev and production builds.

```tsx
import { AppProvider } from 'sunpeak';

// This is handled by the framework — shown here for reference only.
<AppProvider appInfo={{ name: 'MyResource', version: '1.0.0' }}>
  <MyResource />
</AppProvider>
```

### Props

<ResponseField name="appInfo" type="{ name: string; version: string }" required>
  App identification information sent to the host.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="capabilities" type="Record<string, unknown>">
  Capabilities to advertise to the host. Optional.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="onAppCreated" type="(app: App) => void">
  Callback invoked when a new App instance is created. Optional.
</ResponseField>
