## Overview

The sunpeak CLI commands support a complete development lifecycle, from project creation to production builds. This page explains how the commands work together.

## Development Lifecycle

```

### 1. Create

Install sunpeak globally:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -g sunpeak
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g sunpeak
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add sunpeak
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then start a new project:

```bash
sunpeak new
```

This scaffolds a complete sunpeak project with all the configuration and structure you need.

### 2. Develop

Run the development server with hot reload:

```bash
sunpeak dev
```

This starts:
- The simulator at `http://localhost:6767` for local development
- An MCP server at `http://localhost:6766` for testing with real MCP clients

Both servers support Hot Module Reload, letting you iterate quickly on your App UI.

### 3. Build

Create production-ready bundles:

```bash
sunpeak build
```

This compiles and optimizes your Resources for deployment.

### 4. Deploy

Deploy your built resources to your production MCP server. See the [Deployment Guide](/guides/deployment) for details on publishing to ChatGPT and hosting your resources.
