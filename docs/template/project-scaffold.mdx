## Overview

When you create a new project with `sunpeak new`, the sunpeak framework gives you a minimal, convention-based project structure with everything needed for MCP App development.

<ProjectStructure />

## Key Files & Directories

- `src/resources/` - Directory containing all your MCP Resources (MCP App UIs).
    - Each resource lives in its own folder: `src/resources/{name}/`
    - Each folder contains:
        - `{name}-resource.tsx` - React component + resource metadata (`export const resource: ResourceConfig`)
        - `components/` - Optional subfolder for resource-specific components
- `tests/simulations/` - Directory containing simulation files for local development and testing.
    - Each resource's simulations live in their own folder: `tests/simulations/{name}/`
    - Simulation files follow the naming convention: `{name}-{scenario}-simulation.json`
- `tests/e2e/` - Directory containing end-to-end Playwright tests for each resource.
    Uses the ChatGPTSimulator to test your resources render properly with any state (tool calls, saved state, dark mode, pip display mode, etc.).

<Note>
No entry point files needed! The framework automatically discovers your simulations and resources using conventions.

## Included Tooling

The template includes minimal, essential tooling:

### Vite

Fast build tool with hot-reload (HMR) for instant development feedback. The framework owns the dev server configuration - just run `sunpeak dev`.

### Tailwind CSS 4

Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Pre-configured via Vite plugin.

### TypeScript

Type safety with TypeScript 5. Configured via `tsconfig.json`.

### Vitest (Unit Tests)

Vite-native testing framework for component testing. Run with `pnpm test`.

### Playwright (E2E Tests)

End-to-end testing against the ChatGPT Simulator. Tests live in `tests/e2e/`. Run with `pnpm test:e2e`.

### Add Your Own Tooling

The template is intentionally minimal. Add your preferred tools as needed:
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Type checking**: Run `tsc --noEmit` as a script
